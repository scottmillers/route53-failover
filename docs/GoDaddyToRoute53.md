# How to use GoDaddy as the registrar and to Route 53 as the DNS service


I purchased a domain on GoDaddy and use Route53 to manage my DNS records.



## Use GoDaddy as the registrar and Route53 as the DNS service

1. Go to Route53 and create a Hosted Zone
2. Get the 4 Name Servers from Route53
3. Go to GoDaddy and update the Name Servers to the 4 Name Servers from Route53




## Transfer the Domain from GoDaddy to Route53

This other option is to transfer the domain from GoDaddy to Route53
    - This is the best option if you want to manage your domain and DNS records in the same place
    - But due to ICANN rules, you can't transfer a domain within 60 days of buying it
    - So that is not an option
